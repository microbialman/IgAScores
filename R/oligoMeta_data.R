#' Metadata for the OligoMM12-Colitis experiment used as an example in the IgAScores package
#'
#' Metadata for an experiment where mice with a defined gut microbiota (OligoMM12) were either given *Helicobacter hepaticus* and IL10R antibody or the anitbody alone (the first developing colitis).
#' These data accompany the species level counts in oligoSpecies and also include a negative extraction control. A subset of the combined condition were not properly colonised by *H.hepaticus* and excluded from later analyses.
