Description: Functions to calculate indices used to score immunoglobulin A (IgA) binding of bacteria in IgA sequencing (IgA-Seq) experiments.
  This includes the original Kau and Palm indices and more recent methods as described in Jackson et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.08.19.257501>.
  Additionally the package contains a function to simulate IgA-Seq data and an example experimental data set for method testing.
