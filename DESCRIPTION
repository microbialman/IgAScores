Description: This package contains functions to calculate various different indices that have been used to score IgA binding to bacteria in IgA-Seq experiments.
  This includes the original Kau and Palm indices and more recent probability-based methods, which utilise Bayes' theorem to account for the relative abundances 
  to accurately quantify the liklihood of IgA binding per taxon. The package contains individual functions for each method to calculate scores for a single 
  sample and taxa and the function igascores() that calculates any of the scores table-wide (for multiple taxa and samples). Additionally there are functions 
  for simulating IgA-Seq datasets and example data from the IgAScores publication.
